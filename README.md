## Instructions

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManikSinghSarmaal/YOLO_custom

# Create a new conda environment and activate it
conda create --name yolov7_env python=3.11
conda activate yolov7_env

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd YOLOv7_custom

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the check_preds.py script to test detections using webcam feed
python check_preds.py

#Optionally, you can modify the check_preds.py script to change the input source to an image file or video by adjusting the source_path variable.
